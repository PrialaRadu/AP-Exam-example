# AP-Exam-example

The code I wrote while preparing for my AP (Algorithms and Programming in Python) exam. This is an exam subject from the previous year.

I implemented every functionality. The code also handles every possible error.

The code was written and tested in 37 minutes.

Main concepts that this exam tests:
 - Object-Oriented Programming
 - File Handling
 - User Interface (UI)
 - Data Validation
 - Data Structures
 - Error Handling
 - Testing and Debugging
